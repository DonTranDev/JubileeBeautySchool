<p>Note: *The State of Washington requires 500 hours of training for instructor training. Jubilee Beauty School requires an additional 100 hours (600 total hours). These additional hours are used for
individualized state board preparations as well as specific hands-on experiences to ensure those in the program are best prepared for the industry.</p>

exams will be licensed to work as a Cosmetology Instructor. The objective of this program and 
curriculum is to prepare the students to become great Cosmetologists, Hair Designers, Barbers, Manicurists, 
and Estheticians. It is also our mission to develop effective communication skills to connect with 
future pros from different generations, as well as learning styles and techniques to address different 
behaviors, evaluate performance, and guide their students to reach their career goals. Upon the completion of six hundred (600) clock hours, 
a student will obtain a license and be fully qualified to begin working as an entry-level instructor.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONAL METHOD: The training provided will prepare the graduates with the knowledge and 
skills needed to pass the State Board Examination, and if desired, pursue an entry-level position as
